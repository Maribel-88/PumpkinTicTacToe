## PumpkinTicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe is one of the most popular games for software developer students. I chose to work on this game and put my personal touches on it.
This game offers the option to be played with computer as second player. Also you can choose from different characters before starting the game.

After choosing you character , the player info board will be generated. On the top left corner will be your choosen character, which will be the player one. On the top right corner will be the computer player, assigned to be 
the player two. The player board contains the player name, image , name of the character, and the score. The Tic Tac Toe table board is set in the middle of the page. The player one(you) will be the first one to move followed by the 
computer. At the below the table board is a div that contains information who's turn it is and below that is a clear game button. This button lets you clear the table and restart an empty table. Eveytime both player is choosing a box,
there will be a sound indicating the placement of the character in the that box. At the end of each game there will be a popup message. It contains a message depending on the result of the game and this comes with sound too again depends
on the result of the game. If player one wins the score will be added to its score board and if it's the second player wins the score will be added to second player's score board.

## Future Features
Features Left to Implement

- I am looking forward to add an option to make the computer player a bit smarter by making a code to base it's move not just randomly selecting an empty box.
  This will create the option of changing the difficulty level of the game from easy to difficult.
